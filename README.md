# ASCII/Text - Based Game  

## Description 
Two cowboy shooters in a small town face off, taking a few steps back. With a swift draw at 1..2..3, one falls.

## Installation 
To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your system has GCC.
2. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/duhawala/Kings-Legion`.
3. I have already compiled the code using GCC with the command **g++ main.cpp**, so you don't need to compile it again.
4. After compilation using GCC in C++, another file is generated, which is **a.out**
5. To run the application directly, use **./a.out**

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1.  Follow the procedure given in the [Installation](https://github.com/duhawala/Kings-Legion#installation) section.
2.  Basically, it's a Hangman game; follow the prompts and guess the word.
